Incidence:

Down syndrome occurs in
approximately 1 in 600 births.

Male: female ratio at birth is 1.24 : 1.0

--- Page Break ---

Genotypes of Down syndrome:

1-Meiotic non-disjunction
trisomy 21 95%

2 - Translocation Trisomy
4%

3- Mosaic type 1%

--- Page Break ---

1. Meiotic non-disjunction (Maternal age
dependent DS)

eAll the cells show an additional No.
21 chromosome, i.e. 47, XX, +21. This

type is resulting from meiotic non-
disjunction.

eApproximately 95% of all Down
syndrome are of this type.

eAbout 70% of trisomy 21 1s
born to mothers over 30 years.

eHowever, karyotyping of
both parents is usually normal.

2 - Translocation Trisomy 21

eAll cells show normal number of
chromosomes (46), however an extra-
chromosome 21 is attached to another
one (13,14, 15 or 21) 1.e. 46, XX, +t (14q
21q).

eApproximately 4% of Down syndrome
is of this type.

The mechanisms of underlying
translocation are:

â€˜Sporadic type: half of translocated Down
syndrome arise de novo in the affected individual.
Both parents are usually normal.

eInherited type: another half inherited the disease
from a balanced translocation carrier parents 1.e. 45,
XX, t (14q 21q).

3. Mosiacism: (Mitotic  non-
disjunction).

eThis type represents 1% of Down
syndrome.

eThey have various proportions of trisomy
21 (47, XX, + 21) and normal cells (46, XX).

eThis group may be of normal intelligence,
depending on the number of trisomic cells
present.

e. The parents are usually normal
